phpMyID is a small, fairly lightweight, standalone, single user Identity
Provider for OpenID authentication. It comprises a single PHP script that can be
used by one individual to run their own personal OpenID "IdP."

This program requires no external libraries, and has very minimal requirements.
It should run on any PHP 4/5 server, and as long as it built without
intentionally disabling the bcmath functions, it should support 'Smart Mode.'
This program caches all data using built-in PHP session handling, so it requires
no database, and no explicit write access to the file system.

User authentication is done using HTTP Digest authentication, so your password
is never transmitted over the wire in plain text.


For more information on OpenID, please see http://openid.net


INSTALLATION

phpMyID can be installed on just about any PHP server. It is recommended that
you use a server that you own and control.

1) You first need to determine your authentication realm. By default this is
   just the string 'phpMyID' - however, PHP will alter it if running in "safe
   mode." (I disagree with the reasons for doing this, but I can't control PHP,
   nor is it possible to work around this on a programmatic level.)

   If you are using "safe mode" your realm is the string 'phpMyID-12345' where
   the number 12345 represents the uid of the script owner on the server.

   If you are uncertain what this means, or if you are running "safe mode," you
   can upload the script MyID.php to your webserver and view the corresponding
   URL. If you have made no edits to the script, and have not uploaded the
   config file, you will get an error like the following:

    Configuration is missing.
    Default realm: phpMyID-101

   If you did upload the config file or edit the script, you may see a different
   message, but in either case, the server should tell you the correct realm
   value to use.


2) Next you must decide your login name and password. This is what you will use
   to authenticate yourself to phpMyID. Your login name can be anything you
   like.

   To create your password, you will need an MD5 hashing utility. If you are a
   Linux or OSX user, you can use openssl. Simply open a terminal and type:

    $ echo -n 'username:realm:password' | openssl md5

   If you are a Windows user, and do not already have an MD5 hashing tool, one
   is available at http://siege.org/projects/phpMyID . To use it, download
   the exe, and open a cmd session. Use it as follows:

    C:\Documents and Settings\cniemira>cd Desktop
    C:\Documents and Settings\cniemira\Desktop>md5.exe -d"username:realm:password"

   In either case, make sure to substitute your username and password where
   indicated. You must also substitute "realm" for your authentication realm as
   determined in step 1. The resulting output, which will be a long alphanumeric
   string, is your Digest password that can be entered into the 'auth_password'
   field where indicated below.


3) Follow exactly one of the following steps to finalize your phpMyID script
   configuration.


3a) For a single user with an internal configuration (easiest):

    Edit the file MyID.php and look for the 'configuration' section up top.
    You will need to uncomment the '$profile' section, and optionally the
    '$sreg' section. Simply change the field values as needed.

    To finish installation, upload or copy only the file MyID.php, to a web
    accessable directory on your PHP server. You can rename it if you like. This
    is your ID file.

    To upgrade phpMyID, you follow the same installation path.


3b) For a single user with an external configuration:

    Edit the file MyID.config.php. You will need to change the field values for
    the '$profile' section, and optionally uncomment and change any fields in
    the '$sreg' section to set your profile.

    Do not edit the file MyID.php

    To finish installation, upload or copy both the files MyID.config.php and
    MyID.php to a web accessable directory on your PHP server. You can rename
    MyID.php if you like, as it is your ID file.

    To upgrade phpMyID, you only need to replace MyID.php with the new version.


3c) For muliple users (NOT RECOMMENDED):

    For each user, make a copy of the file MyID.config.php and give it a unique
    name (such as 'usersname.php', 'cjniemira.php', 'soandso.php', etc...).
    Edit the copied file and change the field values for the '$profile' section.
    Optionally, you can uncomment and change any fields in the '$sreg' section
    to set the user's profile.

    Do not edit the file MyID.php

    To finish installation, upload or copy both the files MyID.php file and
    all copies of the 'user' file to the same web accessable directory on your
    PHP server. For each person using the system, the renamed copy of
    'MyId.config.php' which contains their profile information is their ID file.

    To upgrade phpMyID, you only need to replace MyID.php with the new version.


4) Visit the corresponding URL for the ID file you just uploaded and you will be
   greeted by a message like the following:

    This is an OpenID server endpoint. For more information, see http://openid.net/
    Server: http://siege.org/MyID.php
    Realm: phpMyID-101

   Be certain that the 'Realm' listed exactly matches the value you used when
   you created your password hash in step 2.

   The Server URL, in this case the one for siege.org, is your Identity Provider
   URL. This is this URL you must link as your openid.server.

   The preferred way of setting this up is to determine the URL you wish to
   authenticate as (for example "siege.org", in my case), and add the following
   to the HTML head section for the index/default document:

    <link rel="openid.server" href="http://siege.org/MyID.php">
    <link rel="openid.delegate" href="http://siege.org/MyID.php">

   You may now use your URL with OpenID (again, "siege.org" in my case).

   As an alternative to editing another document, you may refer directly to the
   phpMyID.php script as your claimed identity (aka, your OpenID login). It
   contains the necessary headers automatically.

   For example, I could log in to an OpenID protected site as:

    http://siege.org			- because I placed the server and
					  delegate headers in the page presented
					  by that url.
	- or -
    http://siege.org/MyID.php		- because the script automatically adds
					  the required headers.

   I could also use:
	- http://siege.org
	- siege.org (I don't have to specify the "http://" part)
	- siege.org/MyID.php
	- www.siege.org
	- and so on...


USAGE

There isn't much to using phpMyID other than pointing at it, and logging in.
If you wish, you can log out by visiting:

  http://yourdomain.com/path/to/MyID.php?openid.mode=logout

There is also a 'log in' mode that will prompt you for credentials without
having to be referred from a client site.

 http://yourdomain.com/path/to/MyID.php?openid.mode=login


TROUBLESHOOTING

*) Received error: "Missing expected authorization realm."

   phpMyID must be able to read http request headers which are only available if
   PHP is running as a webserver module. If you are using PHP in CGI mode, you
   must convert the HTTP 'Authorization' header into an environment variable
   ("PHP_AUTH_DIGEST") or query parameter ("auth") that can then be used to
   perform the authorization.

   If you are using Apache, the included 'htaccess' file contains three examples
   of how you can use mod_rewrite or mod_setenvif directives to to set the
   necessary variable. If you need to use this technique, it is recommended
   that you place phpMyID in its own directory, isolated from the rest of your
   web site.


*) Turning on the Debug Log

   phpMyID has a built-in debug function that will log information about what it
   is attempting to do. You can activate this by adding 'debug' to your profile
   array.

    $profile['debug'] = true;

   The default location of the debug log is 'phpMyID.debug.log' in your temp dir
   as discovered by sys_get_temp_dir. If the system temp dir cannot be
   automatically discovered, phpMyID will attempt to use its own base directory.
   This will almost certainly fail and generate an error message. Visiting the
   script URL directly should indicate the problem.

   You can specify the location of the log file by setting 'logfile' in your
   profile array:

    $profile['logfile'] = '/var/tmp/phpMyID.debug.log';


*) Login never works? Double check your authentication realm

   Digest authentication can be a bit tricky to set up properly. One of the
   biggest stumbling blocks has to do with the authentication realm as described
   under installation step 1. If you change servers or if any settings on your
   server changes, it is possible that your authentication realm will change as
   well. If that happens, you will no longer be able to authenticate to phpMyID,
   and must re-create your password hash.

   When you log in to phpMyID, your web browser will present the authentication
   realm to you in the login box it pops up. It will say something like this:

    Enter username and password for "phpMyID-101" at http://siege.org

  The quoted value in the above is your authentication realm. Make sure that is
  the same value you used when you created your password hash.
